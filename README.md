    A brief description of why this project was created was a way to learn how to code but to also show everyone a little bit about me and my life. This project really helped me learn how to code. I think HTML and CSS are great ways to start off by learning how to code. These programming languages help you get an idea and build a foundation for learning other programming languages. I learned how to create my own website. I was able to learn not just how to add words but to also add picture videos and even a nav bar which makes my website a little bit easier to navigate. With CSS I learned how to style my website whether it was adding color, text size, or even borders. CSS is cool because you get to really enhance your creativity when coding in it.  These are the colors that I used while making my project.
    #3299AD, #3C707A,#14BEE0, #314447, #2D3233. I wasn't able to add pictures on here. I did write all of the code by myself but I did go to this one website to help me out whenever I needed it. The website site was https://www.w3schools.com/css/ I would use this website if I had some questions about border radius or other things.

    To build my hamburger menu I used Erik Terwins code the link to the code is https://codepen.io/erikterwan/pen/EVzeRP

    The Nav  bar was a little bit difficult to make I can't like I did struggle a lot. I tried a lot of different things with the hamburger menu but I could not pull through with my code. It was a struggle never the less I ended up making it out pretty good.
