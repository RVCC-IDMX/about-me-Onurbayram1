            <h2>The Life of Samuel Johnson </h2>

            <div> <p>'Colley Cibber, Sir, was by no means a blockhead;
                 but by arrogating to himself too much, he was in danger
                  of losing that degree of estimation to which he was
                   entitled. His friends gave out that he INTENDED his 
                   birth-day Odes should be bad: but that was not the case,
                    Sir; for he kept them many months by him, and a few years
                     before he died he shewed me one of them, with great
                      solicitude to render it as perfect as might be, and I
                       made some corrections, to which he was not very willing 
                       to submit. I remember the following couplet in allusion 
                       to the King and himself:</p>

                <p>"Perch'd on the eagle's soaring wing,</p>
                
                <p>The lowly linnet loves to sing."</p>
                
                <p>Sir, he had heard something of the fabulous tale of the 
                    wren sitting upon the eagle's wing, and he had applied 
                    it to a linnet. Cibber's familiar style, however, was 
                    better than that which Whitehead has assumed. GRAND nonsense
                     is insupportable. Whitehead is but a little man to inscribe 
                     verses to players.</p>
                
                <p>'Sir, I do not think Gray a first-rate poet. He has
                     not a bold imagination, nor much command of words. 
                     The obscurity in which he has involved himself will 
                     not persuade us that he is sublime. His Elegy in a 
                     Church-yard has a happy selection of images,
                      but I don't like what are called his great things. 
                      His Ode which begins</p>
                
                <p>"Ruin seize thee, ruthless King,</p>
                
                <p>Confusion on thy banners wait!"</p>
                
                <p>has been celebrated for its abruptness, and plunging 
                    into the subject all at once. But such arts as these 
                    have no merit, unless when they are original. We admire
                     them only once; and this abruptness has nothing new in 
                     it. We have had it often before. Nay, we have it in the 
                     old song of Johnny Armstrong:</p>
                
                <p>"Is there ever a man in all Scotland</p>
                
                <p>From the highest estate to the lowest degree," &c.</p></div>
