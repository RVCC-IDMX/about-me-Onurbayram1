            <h2> Biography:</h2>

            <div>
                <p> I want to be....</p>

                <p>A software enginer. That is the job that I hope to get after my 4 years of college
                    I enjoy working on the front end portion of a website because it allows me to be creative
                    and show my creativity.
                </p>

                <p> I'm a active guy. I like to get out in nature weather it's hiking or a sport i'll enjoy it.
                    I also am a fan of working out. I've been working out consisntanty for 3 years now and I haven't stopped
                    working out since I started. 
                </p>

                <p> I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I always tell people there's noting that
                    I would rather do then go out to eat with my buddies and we do go out once a week to eat. I really
                    do feel like I have a great family around me along with my friends.

            <ul>
                <li> Snowboading </li>
                    <p>I started to snowboard about 3 years ago. I started when covid was ongoing. I think at that
                        time I was just trying to get out of the hosue and I picked it up. I won't lie my love 
                        for it is slowly fading away. It's also a little bit inconvenient but I still like to get 
                        on the moutain every once and a while. 
                          
                    </p>

                <li> Working Out </li>
                    <p>I would say that my oldest hobby I've kept with is working out. I really do see it
                        as a form of meditation. I feel that working out has improved my life a lot. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/IMG_0652.jpeg" alt="Me golfing">
                <li> Golf </li>
                    <p>This is the newest hobby that I've picked up. I won't lie I am not that good at golf. But I 
                        have never lost a round of golf, but I have only played with people far worse then me.
                        For those wondering the lowest I've scored was a 92 on a Par 70. So pretty ugly but not 
                        terrible

                    </p>
               
                <li> Video Game </li>
                <p>I think most people can agree video games are great. I no longer take video games seriously I 
                    look at it as a way to clear my mine. Sometimes it can be competitive but what else is new. 
                </p>
                <li>Eating </li> 
                <p>As I said before I love going out to eat. Something about food just makes everything feel better.
                    Also you never realize it but some of your best laughs with people are when your eating. 
                </p>

                <h5> Image Hover Effects </h5>
                <p>In the dynamic world of web design, creating an engaging and memorable user 
                experience is crucial. One effective way to capture your audience's attention and
                 add a touch of interactivity to your website is through image hover
                effects. These effects not only enhance visual appeal but also provide
                a seamless and interactive browsing experience. In this blog post,
                 we'll explore the power of image hover effects and how you can use
                them to elevate your website design.</p>

                <img src="img/code-1076533_1280.jpg" alt="Picture of some random code">

                <h6>Why use Hover Effects</h6>
                    <p>Visual Engagment: Image hover effects bring a sense of dynamism to your website. 
                    They allow users to interact with your content in a way that static
                     images cannot achieve. By adding motion or subtle transitions, you 
                     can create a visually stimulating experience that encourages users
                      to explore further.</p>
                
                   <p> User Interaction: Hover effects provide a layer of interaction without
                     requiring a click. This subtle interactivity can be 
                     especially effective in showcasing additional information
                     or revealing hidden details, enticing users to engage with
                     your content.."</p>

                     <div class="row">
                        <div class="column">
                          <img src="img/website-647013_640.jpg" alt="Picture of code" style="width: 100%">
                        </div>
                        <div class="column">
                          <img src="img/arnold-francisca-f77Bh3inUpE-unsplash.jpg" alt="Picture of code on a laptop" style="width:100%">
                        </div>
                      </div>

    
                <p>Highlighting Call-to-Actions:
                    If your website includes buttons or calls-to-action, 
                    image hover effects can draw attention to these elements. 
                    A well-designed hover effect on buttons can guide users 
                    and encourage them to take desired actions.
                    </p>
                
                <h6>Popular Image Hover Effects</h6>
                <p>Zoom In/Out:
                    A classic effect that zooms in or out on an image 
                    as the user hovers over it. This effect is excellent 
                    for showcasing product details or emphasizing the 
                    finer aspects of a photograph.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    Opacity Change: Adjusting the opacity of an image upon hover can 
                    create a subtle and elegant effect. This is often 
                    used to reveal text or additional content overlaid 
                    on the image.</p>
                
                <p>Color Overlay:
                    Adding a color overlay to an image can help maintain 
                    a consistent color scheme while creating a visually 
                    appealing effect. This is particularly effective for 
                    creating a cohesive look across your website./p>
                
                <p>Text Reveal:
                    Conceal additional text or information and reveal
                     it only when the user hovers over the image. This 
                     effect is ideal for providing context or additional 
                     details without cluttering the initial view.</p>
                
                <p>Gradient Transitions:
                    Applying gradient transitions to images upon hover can 
                    add a modern and stylish touch to your website. This 
                    effect works well with backgrounds and can create a 
                    smooth transition between colors.</p>

                <h6>Implementing Image Hover Effects</h6>

                <p>CSS Transitions:
                    CSS is the go-to language for creating hover effects. 
                    Use the :hover pseudo-class along with transitions to
                     smoothly animate properties like scale, opacity, or color.
                </p>

                <p>JavaScript and jQuery:
                    For more complex hover effects, JavaScript 
                    and jQuery can be utilized to handle animations
                     and interactions. This allows for greater customization
                      and control over the behavior of your hover effects.
                </p>

                <p>Frameworks and Libraries:
                    Many front-end frameworks and libraries, such as 
                    Bootstrap and Animate.css, offer pre-built classes
                     for adding hover effects. These can be easily integrated 
                     into your project, saving time and effort.

            <h5> A Deep Dive into CSS Animation</h5>
            <p> In the dynamic world of web development, user 
                experience is key, and one powerful tool that 
                developers have at their disposal is CSS animation.
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) have come a long way since
                their inception, evolving from simple styling language 
                to a dynamic and expressive medium for creating captivating 
                animations. In this blog post, we'll explore the fascinating
                realm of CSS animation, uncovering its potential,
                implementation techniques, and best practices.
            </p>
            <img src="img/fotis-fotopoulos-LJ9KY8pIH3E-unsplash.jpg" alt="Picture of code on computer.">
            <p>CSS animation allows developers to bring web pages
                to life by seamlessly transitioning between different 
                styles. Unlike static designs, animations 
                create a more engaging and interactive user experience.
                They can be applied to a wide range of elements, 
                including text, images, and even entire page layouts.
            </p>

            <h6>Key Concepts</h6>
            <p>Transitions vs. Animations:
                Transitions enable smooth changes in property
                 values over time, providing a sleek transition effect.
                Animations, on the other hand, offer more control 
                and flexibility, allowing developers to define 
                keyframes and create complex motion sequences.</p>
            
                <p>Keyframes:
                Keyframes are the building blocks
                 of CSS animations. They define the styles 
                 at various points during the animation sequence.
                Developers can specify different percentages 
                along the animation timeline to create intricate
                 and customizable motion patterns.
                </p>
                <p></p>Easing Functions:
                Easing functions dictate the speed 
                and acceleration of animations. They range from 
                linear (constant speed) to various types of easing, such as 
                ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out.
                Choosing the right easing function is 
                crucial for achieving a natural and visually
                 appealing motion.
                </p>
